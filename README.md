## Project Overview
This repository contains the development work for our game project requirement of the ITCS 4231/5231 course. Over the semester, we are creating a 3D game prototype in Unity that demonstrates a fully functional play experience, offering an idea of what a completed game would be like.
### What is a Game Prototype?
A game prototype provides a **complete play experience** without the overall content of a completed game.  
Key examples:  
- A prototype of *Super Mario Bros* might include a few functional levels with basic mechanics (e.g., moving, jumping, goombas, mushrooms).  
- A prototype of *Super Smash Bros* might include a limited set of characters and levels with full functionality.
Our game prototype follows these principles by focusing on delivering a polished, functional, and creative experience within the project scope.

## Game Requirements
### Core Requirements
1. Built using **Unity**.  
2. Developed as a **3D game**.  
3. Content must be **appropriate** for all audiences.  
### Project Goals
- Stick to a creative concept while avoiding over-scoping (e.g., RPGs).  
- Aim for simplicity with polished execution inspired by classic arcade games.  
### Grading Criteria
The prototype will be evaluated based on:
- **Functionality**: Does it work without obvious issues or broken components?  
- **Adherence to Design**: Does it follow the initial design document?  
- **Strategic Elements**: Does the game include meaningful decision-making opportunities?  
- **Enjoyability**: Is it fun, engaging, or challenging?

## Assets Usage
Per the **75% Rule**:
- At least 75% of game content (models, scripts, animations, etc.) must be created by our team.  
- Up to 25% of content may come from online sources (e.g., Unity Asset Store, Mixamo.com).  
If external assets are used, they will be credited in the **Assets and Credits** section.

## Current Game Prototype Description
Our team is creating a 3D game set in an egyptian tomb, no real reference to timeline but it is not during ancient times. 20th century timeframe
The object of the game is to solve puzzles within each level in order for the exit to be unlocked.  Currently the puzzles are simple puzzles; a block puzzle, a laser refleciton puzzle, and a third is TBD.
